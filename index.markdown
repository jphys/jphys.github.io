I am a second year IB student preparing to study Physics at the undergraduate level. An interest in mathematics and the physical world drives me to learn and develop my understanding of natural phenomena. I hold an offer to study a Master's course in Physics at Oxford starting October 2022.

Hobbies include: Powerlifting, Personal Finance and Computing.
